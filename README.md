# DESCRIPTION  
This project helps with the security concern for weak passwords. This website/application allows the user to have a random password generated based off certain criteria. 

Password must be between 8-128 characters.
Criteria that the password can include:
 lowercase characters
 uppercase characters
 numerical characters
 special characters

Application will prompt user for character types (at least one must be selected if not all lowercase characters will appear). If all criteria is entered correctly then the password generator will display a password containing only the characters chosen by the user.
